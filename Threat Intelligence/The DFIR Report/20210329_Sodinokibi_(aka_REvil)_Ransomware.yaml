        - Excel called wmic to finally proxy execute regsvr32 with the payload. An attacker wanted to break suspicious parent-child chain (Office app spawns LOLBin).
          But we have command-line in the event which allow us to "restore" this suspicous parent-child chain and detect it.
          Monitor process creation with "wmic process call create" and LOLBins in command-line with parent Office application processes.
